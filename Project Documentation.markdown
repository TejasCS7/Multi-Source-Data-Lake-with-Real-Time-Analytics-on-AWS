## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Overview

### High-Level Architecture  
The pipeline follows a modular, serverless architecture for scalability and cost efficiency:  
1. **Data Ingestion**: Kinesis Data Streams (`manufacturing-data-stream`, `ecommerce-data-stream`) ingest raw data in real-time.  
2. **Data Processing**: Lambda functions (`manufacturing-data-processor`, `ecommerce-data-processor`) process streams and calculate metrics.  
3. **ETL and Cataloging**: AWS Glue crawlers catalog data, and ETL jobs transform it into Parquet format.  
4. **Analytics**: Lambda functions (`manufacturing-analytics`, `ecommerce-analytics`) generate insights, integrated by `data-integration`.  
5. **Orchestration**: Step Functions (`data-lake-orchestration`) manage the end-to-end workflow.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

### Step 1: Data Ingestion with Kinesis  
- **Setup**: Created two Kinesis Data Streams (`manufacturing-data-stream`, `ecommerce-data-stream`) with on-demand capacity.  
- **Simulation**: A Lambda function (`data-ingestion-simulator`) reads raw CSV data from S3 and streams it to Kinesis using the `put_records` API.  


### Step 2: Real-Time Processing with Lambda  
- **Functions**: `manufacturing-data-processor` calculates maintenance priority scores; `ecommerce-data-processor` computes customer value scores.  
- **Metrics**: Achieved **100% Kinesis PutRecord.Success** at sub-10ms latency.  


### Step 3: ETL with AWS Glue  
- **Crawlers**: `manufacturing_data_crawler` and `ecommerce_data_crawler` catalog processed data into the Glue Data Catalog.  
- **ETL Jobs**: `manufacturing_etl_job` and `ecommerce_etl_job` transform data into Parquet, reducing storage by **90% (582KB ‚Üí 159KB)**.  


### Step 4: Analytics and Integration  
- **Analytics**: Lambda functions (`manufacturing-analytics`, `ecommerce-analytics`) generate summaries for visualization.  
- **Integration**: `data-integration` combines insights for cross-domain analysis, calculating metrics like `operational_excellence_score`.  

### Step 5: Orchestration with Step Functions  
- **State Machine**: `data-lake-orchestration` runs ETL and analytics in parallel, ensuring efficient workflow execution.  
- **Configuration**: Used a JSON-based state machine definition to invoke Glue jobs and Lambda functions.
